# Countdown Timer
Welcome to the Countdown Timer project! This application allows users to track time intervals and set countdowns for specific durations or target dates/times. The project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, time handling, and user interaction through either a GUI built with Tkinter or a command-line interface.

Features

Time Input Options: Users can input a specific duration or set a target date/time for the countdown.

Dynamic Display: The remaining time is displayed dynamically and updates in real-time.

Alerts: Provides alerts when the countdown reaches zero.

User Interface: Choose between a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or a command-line interface (CLI).
